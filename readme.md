How the API Works:

When you send a GET request to that URL, it responds with JSON data like this (example format):

```              
{
    "title": "joel Xmd starting messages",
    "bot_name": "joel Xmd bot",
    "creator": "joeljamestech",
    "channel_link": "https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vak2PevK0IBh2pKJPp2K",
    "channel_jid": "120363317462952356@newsletter",
    "thumbnail": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeljamestech2/JOEL-XMD/refs/heads/main/mydata/media/joelXbot.jpg",
    "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeljamestech2/JOEL-XMD/refs/heads/main/mydata/media/Xstarting.jpg",
    "caption": "Today we recognize your dedication, patience, and hard work. We thank you for your continued trust and loyalty, we will continue to serve you."
}
 ```              
Each Field Explained:

thumbnail: A small image (URL) used as a preview or logo inside the forwarded message's context info.

image: The main image that appears in the message body sent by the bot.

caption: The text shown below the image. It can use dynamic placeholders like ${config.MODE} or ${config.PREFIX}, which are replaced at runtime.

bot_name: The name shown in the forwarded newsletter section to make the bot's identity look official or branded.

title: The title displayed in the clickable preview (external ad reply).

creator: Used in the footer/body of the message to show who developed or powers the bot.


What the Bot Does with This:

1. Fetches the data from the API using axios.get().


2. Replaces placeholders in the caption dynamically (${config.MODE}, etc.).


3. Constructs a WhatsApp message using the fetched image and caption.


4. Sends the message to itself (Matrix.user.id) once connected, using Baileys.



This allows you to:

Update the bot's branding and greeting message remotely,

Use one API for multiple bots,

Avoid hardcoding visual or text content.
