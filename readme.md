How the API Works:

When you send a GET request to that URL, it responds with JSON data like this (example format):

```              
{
  "thumbnail": "https://example.com/thumb.jpg",
  "image": "https://example.com/welcome.jpg",
  "caption": "ʜᴇʟʟᴏ! ᴡᴇʟᴄᴏᴍᴇ ᴛᴏ ${config.MODE} ʙᴏᴛ.\nᴘʀᴇғɪx: ${config.PREFIX}",
  "bot_name": "ᴊᴏᴇʟ-ˣᴍᴅ",
  "title": "ᴡᴇʟᴄᴏᴍᴇ ᴛᴏ ʙᴏᴛ",
  "creator": "ʟᴏʀᴅ ᴊᴏᴇʟ"
}
 ```              
Each Field Explained:

thumbnail: A small image (URL) used as a preview or logo inside the forwarded message's context info.

image: The main image that appears in the message body sent by the bot.

caption: The text shown below the image. It can use dynamic placeholders like ${config.MODE} or ${config.PREFIX}, which are replaced at runtime.

bot_name: The name shown in the forwarded newsletter section to make the bot's identity look official or branded.

title: The title displayed in the clickable preview (external ad reply).

creator: Used in the footer/body of the message to show who developed or powers the bot.


What the Bot Does with This:

1. Fetches the data from the API using axios.get().


2. Replaces placeholders in the caption dynamically (${config.MODE}, etc.).


3. Constructs a WhatsApp message using the fetched image and caption.


4. Sends the message to itself (Matrix.user.id) once connected, using Baileys.



This allows you to:

Update the bot's branding and greeting message remotely,

Use one API for multiple bots,

Avoid hardcoding visual or text content.
